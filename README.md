# dom-api-task

[Demo](https://dmytro-botnarenko.github.io/dom-api-task/)

Training project: Interactive side-menu without page reload.
The main goal is a menu with the ability to load some predefined HTML content associated with its own menu item into the `main` content container on the right/left.

**Feature** (added at my preference): an additional character selection menu appears on screen resolutions over 1600 pixels wide.
